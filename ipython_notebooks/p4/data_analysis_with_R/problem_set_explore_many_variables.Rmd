*Quiz 1: Price Histograms with Facet and Color*
```{r}
# Create a histogram of diamond prices.
# Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars.

# The plot should look something like this.

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type
# 'qual' was used to color the histogram using
# scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.
